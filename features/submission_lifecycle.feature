Feature: A poet's work goes from draft to published/rejected
  As a poet, I want to write my poem on the website, submit it,
  and be aware of what is going on with it while waiting for it
  to either be published or rejected.

  Scenario: I submit when not signed in
    Given I am on the new submission page
    When I fill in the following:
      | Your Email Address | sm@tt.er |
      | Title | Each raindrop   |
      | Body  | started as dust |
    And I press "Submit!"
    Then "Each raindrop" should be submitted, not draft

    And press "Preview"
    Then I should be on my profile page
